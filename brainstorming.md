# Top 3 New App Ideas

1. Cuisine Cravings
2. Synonym Buddy
3. Minecraft Mob-Pedia

## Evaluation of top three ideas

1. Cuisine Cravings
   - **Description**: An app that gives user a new food reccomendation based on their selected region.
   - **Category:** Food
   - **Mobile:** Quick inspiration for when traveling or when cooking.
   - **Story:** When making plans when hanging out with friends and you can't decide where to eat. This makes it easier to decide and enjoy.
   - **Market:** Food lovers and travelers
   - **Habit:** Frequently for those who need to eat new foods
   - **Scope:** Reasonable? API documentation is easy to understand. Simple query parameters for ingredients and region.

2. Synonym Buddy
   - **Description**: An gives you synonyms of commonly used words to help writers use unique words
   - **Category:** Education
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is useful for when a writer needs quick synonym inspo instead of having to use a laptop 
   - **Story:** Writers often struggle with finding better words to use when writing. A quick mobile companion that gives synonyms saves people from the hassle of using a dictionary or searching on google. 
   - **Market:** Mainly students and professional writers would use this app. Provides value to writers who struggle with synonyms and saves their time. 
   - **Habit:** Writers would use this app every time they are writing to find unique words
   - **Scope:** Finding a dictionary API or a separate synonym API would be the hardest part of the project I think. Other than that it should be easy to set up the layout and connect the API. 

3. Travel Budget Companion 
   - **Description**: An app focused on giving healthy limits to the typical holiday splurge everyone may embark in, to make safe and responsible choices no matter where they are or plan to go.
   - **Category:** LifeStyle
   - **Mobile:** This would fair better as it allows for a far more convient experience, as a mobile money companion is a munch needed tool that can come out .
   - **Story:** Young adults, college students, and many other people from walks of life all have money, and everyone wants to know how to spend it and how much they are spending it. In a society thats making us all money concious, such an app would pave as a light for many people.
   - **Market:** It would be a rather large market, as the main focus would be adults. But in the future, it could be exposed to a more younger market(Teens/Pre-Teens).
   - **Habit:** They would be actually engaged with the app because it's an application that acts as a reminder for spending habits.
   - **Scope:** It would not be a challenging app to create, but it would take a bit of time to get it done.
